Q0. what is the networking in c, which one helps to built the networking in c?
A0. the networking defines the communication of the two or more devices over the internet !, sockets help in building the networking!.
Q1. what are the sockets in c ?
A1. We use the sockets to built the communication of the two systems/computers/embedded_devices;
Q2. how can we implement this in c?
A2. with some header files like 
    1.system socket == (#include<sys/socket.h>), 
    2.network internet == (#include<netinet/in.h>), and 
    3.advance research projects agency internet == (#include<arpa/inet.h>)!
Q3. what is tcp ?
A3. tcp obrivates transfer control protocol, established in the transport layer of open system interface, 
    helps in communication of two devices! offers reliablity communication since it is connection oriented network protocol!
Q4. what is the upd?
A3. udp obrivates user datagram protocol, established in the trnsoport layer of open system interface,
    helps in communication of the two devices!, offers fast communication since it is connection less network protocal!
Q5. what are the main types of the sockets?
A4. there are two main types of sockets
    1. stream socket! (SOCK_STREAM);
    2. datagram socket! (SOCK_DGRAM);
Q6. what are the types of ip_addressess we have actually ?
A6. there are main two types of ip_addressess which are 1. ipv4 == AF_INET, 2. ipv6 == AF_INET6;
Q7. what is the osi ?,what are the layers of OPEN SYSTEM INTERFACE (OSI) help us in communication,
A7. the osi defines how the devices communicate step by step by following the OSI model
    OSI offers 7 layers !
    1.appication layer (what application we use to make the communication);
    2.presentation layer (encryption of the data);
    3.session layer (conducts the session for the communication);
    4.transport layer (offers network protocols (tcp,udp) for communication!);
    5.network layer (adding the network like ipv4 or ipv6) and (data into packets (packet == piece of the data));
    6.data link layer (transfer the data between the devices using samenetwork by the macaddressess) (each packet will be ad frame! );
    7.physical layer (convers the data into signals like electrical singals, light signals and etc.) (each freame will converted as bits ! (0,1));
